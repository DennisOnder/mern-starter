# MERN Stack Starter Kit

> This repository is supposed to hold all the necessary files and dependencies for developing apps within the MERN Stack in a small and neat package.

---

### Scripts:

> Scripts are supposed to be ran from the root-level within the file structure.

* `npm run install-dependencies - Installs all dependencies.`

* `npm run server - Runs Node Server via Nodemon.`

* `npm run dev - Runs the Node and React server at the same time.`

* `npm run dev-sass - Same as 'dev', but runs the node-sass compiler aswell.`
